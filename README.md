The KRK Rokit RP6 G3 monitors automatically go into standby mode after 30 minutes of no activity. 
Sending a signal (i.e. playing audio) to the input of the monitors should automatically wake them up.

Use the script to feel free to listen for as long as you want at a low volume d-_-b.

To bundle it please run:
```
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed KRKMonitorStandbyModeHandler.py
```
